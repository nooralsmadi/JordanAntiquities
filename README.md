# Preprocessing steps:
In all Models, we do the same general preprocessing steps that are:
* Image pixel rescaling: divide pixels by 255 to convert the pixels range from 0-255 to 0-1.
* Image resizing: this step may vary depending on the model used, as each model might have a compatible target size for optimal performance. Below are the target sizes used for resizing images for different models:

| Model         | Target Size Used |
|---------------|------------------|
| Inception V3  | 229              |
| EfficientNet  | 224              |
| VGG16         | 224              |
| ResNet101     | 224              |


* One-hot encoding using LabelBinarizer.
* Data Augmentation.
  We split the data into training and testing sets with an 80:20 ratio, then we apply data augmentation exclusively to the training data.

  Data augmentation is a technique used to enhance the size and diversity of a training dataset by applying various transformations to existing images. This process is pivotal for improving the generalization and robustness of trained models, as it exposes them to a wider range of input variations.

    #### Parameters:

    * Rotation_range: Random rotation range for images, specified in degrees.
    * Horizontal_flip: Boolean indicating random horizontal flipping of images.
    * Width_shift_range: Random width shifting range (horizontal direction) for images.
    * Height_shift_range: Random height shifting range (vertical direction) for images.
    * Shear_range: Random shear transformation range for images.
    * Zoom_range: Random zooming range for images.
    * Fill_mode: Method for filling newly created pixels introduced by transformations; 'nearest' fills with the nearest neighbor value.
  
After defining the augmentation parameters with ImageDataGenerator, the flow() method generates augmented batches of training data from the input images (X_train) and corresponding labels (y_train). The BATCH_SIZE parameter determines the size of each augmented data batch during training.

# Modeling

## Inception V3 Model (Running fine-tune-inception-v3 with 90.9%.ipynb)

Inception v3 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for image classification tasks. It is part of the Inception family of models developed by Google Research. Inception v3 builds upon the success of its predecessors, Inception v1 and Inception v2, by introducing several improvements in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Key Features:

- Inception Modules: The hallmark of the Inception architecture is its use of inception modules, which are composed of multiple parallel convolutional pathways of different kernel sizes. These pathways allow the model to capture features at various scales and resolutions simultaneously, facilitating better representation learning.
- Factorization: Inception v3 employs factorization techniques such as factorized convolutions and dimensionality reduction to reduce the computational cost of the model while preserving its expressive power. This helps in making the model more efficient and suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
- Auxiliary Classifiers: Inception v3 includes auxiliary classifiers at intermediate layers of the network, which serve two purposes: providing additional regularization during training and facilitating the gradient flow through the network. These auxiliary classifiers help in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and improving the overall training stability.
- Batch Normalization: Batch normalization is extensively used throughout the network to accelerate training convergence and reduce the sensitivity to initialization. It normalizes the activations of each layer to have zero mean and unit variance, which helps in improving the gradient flow and reducing the internal covariate shift.
- Global Average Pooling: Instead of fully connected layers at the top of the network, Inception v3 replaces them with global average pooling layers. This reduces the number of parameters in the model and makes it more robust to spatial translations and distortions in the input images.

### Architecture Overview:
Inception v3 consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by inception modules and auxiliary classifiers. The overall architecture can be summarized as follows:

- Input Layer: Accepts input images of predefined dimensions.
- Convolutional Layers: A series of convolutional layers with varying filter sizes and depths to extract hierarchical features from the input images.
- Inception Modules: These modules are the building blocks of the network and contain parallel convolutional pathways of different kernel sizes. They enable the network to capture features at multiple scales and resolutions.
- Auxiliary Classifiers: Auxiliary classifiers are inserted at intermediate layers of the network to aid in training and regularization.
- Final Layers: Global average pooling layers followed by fully connected layers and softmax activation for predicting the class probabilities.

### Transfer Learning Approach:

In our transfer learning approach, we remove the head layer of the Inception V3 pre-trained model and then add our own layers on top. This allows us to leverage the features learned by the pre-trained model and adapt them to a new task or dataset.

#### The layers that we added:

- Global Average Pooling Layer: The `GlobalAveragePooling2D()` layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the features extracted by the base model to a vector of fixed size, effectively summarizing the learned features for each image.
- Dense Layer 1: The `Dense(units=256)` layer is a fully connected layer with 256 units. This layer helps in learning higher-level features from the output of the global average pooling layer.
- Activation (ReLU): The ReLU activation function introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data.
- Batch Normalization: Batch normalization helps stabilize and accelerate the training of deep neural networks by normalizing the input to each layer.
- Dropout: The `Dropout(rate=0.5)` layer randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training, which helps prevent overfitting by forcing the network to learn redundant representations.
- Dense Layer 2 (Output Layer): The final `Dense(units=classes)` layer is the output layer with units equal to the number of classes in the classification task.
- Activation (Softmax): Softmax activation converts the raw output scores into probabilities, where each value represents the probability of the input belonging to a particular class.

## EfficientNet B0 Model (Running fine-tune-efficient-net-b0 with 81%.ipynb):
EfficientNet B0 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture proposed by Google Research that achieves state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks while maintaining high computational efficiency. It is part of the EfficientNet family of models, which are designed to balance model size, accuracy, and computational cost through a novel compound scaling method.

### Key Features:

- Compound Scaling: EfficientNet B0 introduces compound scaling, a method that uniformly scales the network depth, width, and resolution to achieve better performance. By jointly scaling these dimensions, the model achieves higher accuracy without significantly increasing computational cost.
- Depthwise Separable Convolutions: The backbone of EfficientNet B0 is composed of depthwise separable convolutions, which factorize standard convolutions into depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions. This reduces the number of parameters and computations required, making the model more efficient.
- Inverted Residual Blocks: Inspired by MobileNetV2, EfficientNet B0 incorporates inverted residual blocks, which consist of a lightweight bottleneck layer followed by a linear projection layer. This design enables efficient feature extraction while maintaining representational power.
- Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Blocks: To enhance feature discrimination, EfficientNet B0 integrates SE blocks, which dynamically recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on their importance. This mechanism helps the model focus on informative features and suppress irrelevant ones.
- Swish Activation Function: EfficientNet B0 employs the Swish activation function, a smooth and non-monotonic activation function that has been shown to improve training convergence and model performance compared to traditional activation functions like ReLU.

### Architecture Overview:

EfficientNet B0 follows a hierarchical structure with multiple stages of feature extraction. The overall architecture can be summarized as follows:

- Input Layer: Accepts input images of predefined dimensions.
- Stem Convolutional Layers: Initial convolutional layers that extract low-level features from the input images.
- EfficientNet Blocks: The backbone of the network consists of multiple EfficientNet blocks, each comprising a sequence of inverted residual blocks with varying depths and widths. These blocks progressively extract higher-level features from the input.
- Global Average Pooling: A global average pooling layer aggregates spatial information across feature maps to generate a compact representation of the input.
- Fully Connected Layer: The global average pooling output is fed into a fully connected layer followed by a softmax activation function for predicting class probabilities.

2. Custom Fully Connected Layers: On top of the base model, we add custom fully connected layers to adapt the learned features for our specific classification task.

   - Flattening Layer: The Flatten() layer is used to flatten the output of the base model's last convolutional layer into a 1D tensor.  
   - Dense Layer 1: The Dense(units=1024) layer is a fully connected layer with 1024 units, allowing the model to learn high-level features.
   - Activation (ReLU): The ReLU activation function introduces non-linearity to the network, aiding in learning complex patterns.    
   - Dropout: The Dropout(rate=0.5) layer randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training to prevent overfitting.    
   - Dense Layer 2 (Output Layer): The final Dense(units=classes) layer is the output layer with units equal to the number of classes in the classification task.   
   - Activation (Softmax): Softmax activation converts the raw output scores into probabilities, indicating the likelihood of each class.
