# Image Classification for Archaeological Sites using Pre-trained Models

# Overview:
Archaeological research often involves the analysis of images to identify and classify various archaeological sites. This project aims to develop a deep learning model for automated image classification of archaeological sites. Using pre-trained models will be crucial in achieving accurate and efficient results.

# Objectives:

   * Develop a deep-learning model for image classification 
   * Evaluate multiple pre-trained models: InceptionV3, Efficientnet, ResNet, VGGNet 
   * Compare and analyze the performance of each model 
   * Provide a user-friendly demo using Gradio or Streamlit

# Data Collection:
We collect images for archaeological sites (Umm Qais, Jerash, Petra, Ajloun Castle, Wadi Rum, Roman amphitheater)
using:
* Web scraping: we use web scraping in two ways: using giving URL to download images and using giving some keywords, to search about 
  them then download images. 
* Videos: we converted some videos to frames and added some frames to our dataset.  
* Manually: some images are downloaded manually.
